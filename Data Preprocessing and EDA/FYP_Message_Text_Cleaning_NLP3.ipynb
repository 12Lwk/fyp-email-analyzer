         "\"100 Years of Energy\" - ABC Channel 13",
         "We are proud to announce that Enron is one of the title sponsors of the \"100 Years of Energy\" special to air locally on ABC Channel 13, January 13th and 20th at 6:30 p.m. Ken Lay, as a leader in the energy industry, will be one of the featured executives. This special was produced in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Spindletop. With our sponsorship, we also received the opportunity to have four :30 second vignettes about Enron produced by the Channel 13 staff. These spots will run throughout January and February. The spots highlight Enron as a leader in innovation, energy and technology; Enron's involvement in the Houston community; and our corporate environment. I have included the schedule for the next two weeks (see below). Our level of sponsorship also includes two weeks of radio promotion on KTRH and three insertions in the Houston Business Journal. Copies of the special will also be distributed to local schools. I would like to encourage each of you to tune in and watch the special on the 13th or 20th. If you would like copies of the special or the vignettes please let me know. Reproductions are available. I can be reached at x 3-4535. Thank you!

         "\"Alan Greenspan's outfit is troubled by a research report dated Oct. 18",
         "To all G7 clients, We are pleased to see that SOMEONE is reading our survey...hope you are too. Best regards, Jane Hartley CEO G7 Group, Inc. CONSUMERS TOO AFRAID TO SPEND By JOHN CRUDELE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ November 13, 2001 -- CONSUMERS are talking tough and optimistic, but acting weak and glum. That's the big problem in the American economy right now. And things like yesterday's plane crash - whether caused by terrorism or not - are likely to aggravate that situation. The dual personality being exhibited by Americans is bothering the Federal Reserve, whose interest-rate cuts won't be nearly as effective if consumers are too scared to borrow money. I spoke with a source of mine who is familiar with the Fed's thinking and he tells me that monetary authorities are concerned, as well as perplexed, by consumers' unwillingness to part with a dollar even as they are feigning confidence. In particular, Alan Greenspan's outfit is troubled by a research report dated Oct. 18 that was conducted by an independent Washington outfit called G7 Group. The group had the Princeton Survey Research Associates interview 1,045 adults between Oct. 8 and 10. This poll was given tome by someone close to the Fed. The survey found that post-Sept. 11, Americans were putting on a good front. For instance, 66 percent of the people polled said that now is a \"good time\" to purchase a car ora house, but 63 percent said they \"did not feel like\" making a major purchase. Only 41 percent of the respondents felt like shopping for clothes and 75 percent felt comfortable buying only necessities like groceries. Consumer confidence has been dropping since before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But the current level of confidence could be greatly overstated because it measures what people are saying and not what they are doing. And the Princeton Survey shows that consumers are talking a good game but buckling when it comes to taking an economic turn at the plate. Not surprisingly, job security is the chief concern, although Americans refuse to admit it. Even though the U.S. lost 415,000 jobs last month and our unemployment rate jumped sharply to 5.4 percent, more than 70 percent of those surveyed said they felt the same or more optimistic than they did a few months ago. The Fed cut interest rates for the tenth time last week. Another rate cutis expected in December. The Fed made an even bolder move two weeks ago when it announced that it was going to stop selling 30-year government bonds. The result was that interest rates on long bonds came down sharply, putting them more in proportion with recent rate reductions. As I've said in previous columns, the long bond has been a nuisance for the Central Bank because it hasn't declined as much as expected. This has caused things like mortgage rates to remain higher than they could have been. The G7/Princeton survey explains to the Fed why its interest rate strategy hasn't been working. But it doesn't necessarily explain why - as the surveyors concluded - \"the Sept. 11 attacks opened a chasm between what Americans are thinking rationally about the economy and what Americans are feeling as they now confront economic decisions.\" What will yesterday's incident do to confidence? That's anyone's guess. But unless the government quickly explains what happened to the public - and that's unlikely in a crash investigation like this - then Americans are likely to keep up their tough facade while being weak in the knees. Over the last decade America's mood has depended a lot on how Wall Street was feeling. The stock market dipped sharply right after yesterday's plane crash, but snapped back. The Federal Reserve figures, I'm told, that if interest rates stay down and the stock market remains stable, then Americans will eventually regain their confidence. Let's hope so. But if you are investing in a stock market that is this overpriced, you should understand that the risks are great. And they are getting greater. -John Crudele, NY Post, November 13,2001",

It is in Spanish and it is not an ISDA. It is a \"short\" document (i.e., much shorter than a standard ISDA Master Agreement and ISDA Credit Support Annex). (2) This document is being prepared by experienced professionals. Are you involved in this effort? Is ISDA involved? Perhaps we could schedule a conference call and/or you could provide me with an accurate account of any local activity in connection with the foregoing. If ISDA is not being used in Argentina for commodity swaps and derivatives, Enron needs to understand the issues and current discussions about derivatives transactions. I look forward to hearing from you. Regards. Sara",

Randy and I were discussing some additional functionality after the meeting today. . . Is there any reason that we could NOT automate the creation of the buy/sell or brokered paths in UNIFY once the deals have been matched in the Contract Exchange module? Will the Contract Exchange module contain enough information to create the UNIFY path just a scheduler would? In other words, is the path creation process for buy/sell deals only manual \"re-entry\" of the data that will be sitting out in Contract Exchange? OR is there additional information that you need to create the path that is not sitting in Contract Exchange? This, of course, assumes that the meter has been added to the deal in Contract Exchange and the deal has bridged from SITARA to UNIFY. It seems to us that this should be possible and valuable, but please give us your input! Thanks, Carrie",

Prior to the meeting, I wanted to share some background on how this came about and why it maybe relevant to your area of responsibility. During 2000, the International PR team wanted to develop abetter appreciation as to what corporate cultures, operating structures, strategies, tactics and tools were being used to keep pace with the ever-widening and more strategic role communication is being asked to play. As such, several companies got together and asked Laird & Associates ( who has previously completed studies for Enron) to conduct research on the following companies, i.e. BP Amoco, General Electric, Johnson and Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., McDonalds, Nestle, Nokia Corp., and Royal Dutch Shell Group. The presentation will be made by the President of Laird and Associates and you will receive the most important elements of the voluminous analysis and findings they extracted from on-site visits. For your reference, I will forward the final report to your attention. The presentation will take place at the Enron in 47C1.

We want to present to the originators what IT Services are being provided to Bridgeline, discuss the value this can bring to ENA and talk about other potential deals in the works. The thought is to spur additional value creation for Enron by offering services to our customers. This would impact not only IT but Commercial Operations as well. Having them understand what value the two groups can bring to the table and how important it is for our groups to be in on the front end of these deals is important so that these potential deals are negotiated & structured correctly.

These tests will involve a 14-day shut-in of Clay Basin for reservoir gas inventory verification followed immediately by a 2-day field deliverability test. During the 14-day shut-in, Clay Basin customers will not be able to utilize their storage service. However, in order to facilitate the 2-day deliverability test, an Operational Flow Order (OFO) will be issued and storage capacity holders will be required to take a pro-rata share of their withdrawal capacity from a total volume of 300,000 dth in a 32-hour period. Questar will work with storage customers to facilitate transportation of their gas supply during this time period. Questar is interested in finding ways to minimize the impact of this testing on its shippers. Please contact your Questar marketing repesentative to discuss the testing process.",

         "\"100 Years of Energy\" - ABC Channel 13",
         "We are proud to announce that Enron is one of the title sponsors of the \"100 Years of Energy\" special to air locally on ABC Channel 13, January 13th and 20th at 6:30 p.m. Ken Lay, as a leader in the energy industry, will be one of the featured executives. This special was produced in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Spindletop. With our sponsorship, we also received the opportunity to have four :30 second vignettes about Enron produced by the Channel 13 staff. These spots will run throughout January and February. The spots highlight Enron as a leader in innovation, energy and technology; Enron's involvement in the Houston community; and our corporate environment. I have included the schedule for the next two weeks (see below). Our level of sponsorship also includes two weeks of radio promotion on KTRH and three insertions in the Houston Business Journal. Copies of the special will also be distributed to local schools. I would like to encourage each of you to tune in and watch the special on the 13th or 20th. If you would like copies of the special or the vignettes please let me know. Reproductions are available. I can be reached at x 3-4535. Thank you!

         "\"Alan Greenspan's outfit is troubled by a research report dated Oct. 18",
         "To all G7 clients, We are pleased to see that SOMEONE is reading our survey...hope you are too. Best regards, Jane Hartley CEO G7 Group, Inc. CONSUMERS TOO AFRAID TO SPEND By JOHN CRUDELE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ November 13, 2001 -- CONSUMERS are talking tough and optimistic, but acting weak and glum. That's the big problem in the American economy right now. And things like yesterday's plane crash - whether caused by terrorism or not - are likely to aggravate that situation. The dual personality being exhibited by Americans is bothering the Federal Reserve, whose interest-rate cuts won't be nearly as effective if consumers are too scared to borrow money. I spoke with a source of mine who is familiar with the Fed's thinking and he tells me that monetary authorities are concerned, as well as perplexed, by consumers' unwillingness to part with a dollar even as they are feigning confidence. In particular, Alan Greenspan's outfit is troubled by a research report dated Oct. 18 that was conducted by an independent Washington outfit called G7 Group. The group had the Princeton Survey Research Associates interview 1,045 adults between Oct. 8 and 10. This poll was given to me by someone close to the Fed. The survey found that post-Sept. 11, Americans were putting on a good front. For instance, 66 percent of the people polled said that now is a \"good time\" to purchase a car or a house, but 63 percent said they \"did not feel like\" making a major purchase. Only 41 percent of the respondents felt like shopping for clothes and 75 percent felt comfortable buying only necessities like groceries. Consumer confidence has been dropping since before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But the current level of confidence could be greatly overstated because it measures what people are saying and not what they are doing. And the Princeton Survey shows that consumers are talking a good game but buckling when it comes to taking an economic turn at the plate. Not surprisingly, job security is the chief concern, although Americans refuse to admit it. Even though the U.S. lost 415,000 jobs last month and our unemployment rate jumped sharply to 5.4 percent, more than 70 percent of those surveyed said they felt the same or more optimistic than they did a few months ago. The Fed cut interest rates for the tenth time last week. Another rate cut is expected in December. The Fed made an even bolder move two weeks ago when it announced that it was going to stop selling 30-year government bonds. The result was that interest rates on long bonds came down sharply, putting them more in proportion with recent rate reductions. As I've said in previous columns, the long bond has been a nuisance for the Central Bank because it hasn't declined as much as expected. This has caused things like mortgage rates to remain higher than they could have been. The G7/Princeton survey explains to the Fed why its interest rate strategy hasn't been working. But it doesn't necessarily explain why - as the surveyors concluded - \"the Sept. 11 attacks opened a chasm between what Americans are thinking rationally about the economy and what Americans are feeling as they now confront economic decisions.\" What will yesterday's incident do to confidence? That's anyone's guess. But unless the government quickly explains what happened to the public - and that's unlikely in a crash investigation like this - then Americans are likely to keep up their tough facade while being weak in the knees. Over the last decade America's mood has depended a lot on how Wall Street was feeling. The stock market dipped sharply right after yesterday's plane crash, but snapped back. The Federal Reserve figures, I'm told, that if interest rates stay down and the stock market remains stable, then Americans will eventually regain their confidence. Let's hope so. But if you are investing in a stock market that is this overpriced, you should understand that the risks are great. And they are getting greater. -John Crudele, NY Post, November 13,2001",

         "\"Argentine Association of Derivatives\"",
         "Happy New Year! I was hoping you could respond to some issues raised by Enron's Argentine commercial group. They have told me the following: (1) An association known as the \"Argentine Association of Derivatives\" has developed a document currently being circulated in the Argentine market for use in the near term. It is in Spanish and it is not an ISDA. It is a \"short\" document (i.e., much shorter than a standard ISDA Master Agreement and ISDA Credit Support Annex). (2) This document is being prepared by experienced professionals. Are you involved in this effort? Is ISDA involved? Perhaps we could schedule a conference call and/or you could provide me with an accurate account of any local activity in connection with the foregoing. If ISDA is not being used in Argentina for commodity swaps and derivatives, Enron needs to understand the issues and current discussions about derivatives transactions. I look forward to hearing from you. Regards. Sara",

In my opinion this does not guarantee data integrity between the systems. Carrie and I have scheduled a meeting for 1:30 pm today in 21c2 to discuss. Please feel free to attend and give your opinions. ---------------------- Forwarded by Randall L Gay/HOU/ECT on 10/17/2000 06:35 AM --------------------------- Carrie Slagle 10/16/2000 05:11 PM To: Lisa Kinsey/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stacey J Brewer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tricia Bowen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eddie Janzen/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Randall L Gay/HOU/ECT@ECT, Molly Sumrow/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: \"Auto-Pathing\" Buy/Sells Hello! Randy and I were discussing some additional functionality after the meeting today. . . Is there any reason that we could NOT automate the creation of the buy/sell or brokered paths in UNIFY once the deals have been matched in the Contract Exchange module? Will the Contract Exchange module contain enough information to create the UNIFY path just a scheduler would? In other words, is the path creation process for buy/sell deals only manual \"re-entry\" of the data that will be sitting out in Contract Exchange? OR is there additional information that you need to create the path that is not sitting in Contract Exchange? This, of course, assumes that the meter has been added to the deal in Contract Exchange and the deal has bridged from SITARA to UNIFY. It seems to us that this should be possible and valuable, but please give us your input! Thanks, Carrie",

Prior to the meeting, I wanted to share some background on how this came about and why it may be relevant to your area of responsibility. During 2000, the International PR team wanted to develop a better appreciation as to what corporate cultures, operating structures, strategies, tactics and tools were being used to keep pace with the ever-widening and more strategic role communication is being asked to play. As such, several companies got together and asked Laird & Associates ( who has previously completed studies for Enron) to conduct research on the following companies, i.e. BP Amoco, General Electric, Johnson and Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., McDonalds, Nestle, Nokia Corp., and Royal Dutch Shell Group. The presentation will be made by the President of Laird and Associates and you will receive the most important elements of the voluminous analysis and findings they extracted from on-site visits. For your reference, I will forward the final report to your attention. The presentation will take place at the Enron in 47C1. Please feel free to invite any others you feel might benefit from this material. Thank you in advance for anticipated cooperation. Do not hesitate to call, if you have any questions.",

In order to avoid \"legal/credit Tuesday\" boredom, we propose Wednesday or Thursday as a regular luncheon meeting date. How does the week of February 19 or 26 sound?

         "RE: NOTICE TO CLAY BASIN CAPACITY HOLDERS Questar Pipeline Company (Questar) is planning to perform Clay Basin inventory verification and deliverability tests beginning April 2, 2002. These tests will involve a 14-day shut-in of Clay Basin for reservoir gas inventory verification followed immediately by a 2-day field deliverability test. D uring the 14-day shut-in, Clay Basin customers will not be able to utilize their storage service. However, in order to facilitate the 2-day deliverability test, an Operational Flow Order (OFO) will be issued and storage capacity holders will be required to take a pro-rata share of their withdrawal capacity from a total volume of 300,000 dth in a 32-hour period. Questar will work with storage customers to facilitate transportation of their gas supply during this time period. Questar is interested in finding ways to minimize the impact of this testing on its shippers. Please contact your Questar marketing repesentative to discuss the testing process.",

         "We are proud to announce that Enron is one of the title sponsors of the \"100 Years of Energy\" special to air locally on ABC Channel 13, January 13th and 20th at 6:30 p.m. Ken Lay, as a leader in the energy industry, will be one of the featured executives. This special was produced in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Spindletop. With our sponsorship, we also received the opportunity to have four :30 second vignettes about Enron produced by the Channel 13 staff. These spots will run throughout January and February. The spots highlight Enron as a leader in innovation, energy and technology; Enron's involvement in the Houston community; and our corporate environment. I have included the schedule for the next two weeks (see below). Our level of sponsorship also includes two weeks of radio promotion on KTRH and three insertions in the Houston Business Journal. Copies of the special will also be distributed to local schools. I would like to encourage each of you to tune in and watch the special on the 13th or 20th. If you would like copies of the special or the vignettes please let me know. Reproductions are available. I can be reached at x 3-4535. Thank you!

         "\"Alan Greenspan's outfit is troubled by a research report dated Oct. 18",
         "To all G7 clients, We are pleased to see that SOMEONE is reading our survey...hope you are too. Best regards, Jane Hartley CEO G7 Group, Inc. CONSUMERS TOO AFRAID TO SPEND By JOHN CRUDELE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ November 13, 2001 -- CONSUMERS are talking tough and optimistic, but acting weak and glum. That's the big problem in the American economy right now. And things like yesterday's plane crash - whether caused by terrorism or not - are likely to aggravate that situation. The dual personality being exhibited by Americans is bothering the Federal Reserve, whose interest-rate cuts won't be nearly as effective if consumers are too scared to borrow money. I spoke with a source of mine who is familiar with the Fed's thinking and he tells me that monetary authorities are concerned, as well as perplexed, by consumers' unwillingness to part with a dollar even as they are feigning confidence. In particular, Alan Greenspan's outfit is troubled by a research report dated Oct. 18 that was conducted by an independent Washington outfit called G7 Group. The group had the Princeton Survey Research Associates interview 1,045 adults between Oct. 8 and 10. This poll was given tome by someone close to the Fed. The survey found that post-Sept. 11, Americans were putting on a good front. For instance, 66 percent of the people polled said that now is a \"good time\" to purchase a car ora house, but 63 percent said they \"did not feel like\" making a major purchase. Only 41 percent of the respondents felt like shopping for clothes and 75 percent felt comfortable buying only necessities like groceries. Consumer confidence has been dropping since before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But the current level of confidence could be greatly overstated because it measures what people are saying and not what they are doing. And the Princeton Survey shows that consumers are talking a good game but buckling when it comes to taking an economic turn at the plate. Not surprisingly, job security is the chief concern, although Americans refuse to admit it. Even though the U.S. lost 415,000 jobs last month and our unemployment rate jumped sharply to 5.4 percent, more than 70 percent of those surveyed said they felt the same or more optimistic than they did a few months ago. The Fed cut interest rates for the tenth time last week. Another rate cutis expected in December. The Fed made an even bolder move two weeks ago when it announced that it was going to stop selling 30-year government bonds. The result was that interest rates on long bonds came down sharply, putting them more in proportion with recent rate reductions. As I've said in previous columns, the long bond has been a nuisance for the Central Bank because it hasn't declined as much as expected. This has caused things like mortgage rates to remain higher than they could have been. The G7/Princeton survey explains to the Fed why its interest rate strategy hasn't been working. But it doesn't necessarily explain why - as the surveyors concluded - \"the Sept. 11 attacks opened a chasm between what Americans are thinking rationally about the economy and what Americans are feeling as they now confront economic decisions.\" What will yesterday's incident do to confidence? That's anyone's guess. But unless the government quickly explains what happened to the public - and that's unlikely in a crash investigation like this - then Americans are likely to keep up their tough facade while being weak in the knees. Over the last decade America's mood has depended a lot on how Wall Street was feeling. The stock market dipped sharply right after yesterday's plane crash, but snapped back. The Federal Reserve figures, I'm told, that if interest rates stay down and the stock market remains stable, then Americans will eventually regain their confidence. Let's hope so. But if you are investing in a stock market that is this overpriced, you should understand that the risks are great. And they are getting greater. -John Crudele, NY Post, November 13,2001",

They have told me the following: (1) An association known as the \"Argentine Association of Derivatives\" has developed a document currently being circulated in the Argentine market for use in the near term. It is in Spanish and it is not an ISDA. It is a \"short\" document (i.e., much shorter than a standard ISDA Master Agreement and ISDA Credit Support Annex). (2) This document is being prepared by experienced professionals. Are you involved in this effort? Is ISDA involved? Perhaps we could schedule a conference call and/or you could provide me with an accurate account of any local activity in connection with the foregoing. If ISDA is not being used in Argentina for commodity swaps and derivatives, Enron needs to understand the issues and current discussions about derivatives transactions.

In my opinion this does not guarantee data integrity between the systems. Carrie and I have scheduled a meeting for 1:30 pm today in 21c2 to discuss.

Randy and I were discussing some additional functionality after the meeting today. . . Is there any reason that we could NOT automate the creation of the buy/sell or brokered paths in UNIFY once the deals have been matched in the Contract Exchange module? Will the Contract Exchange module contain enough information to create the UNIFY path just a scheduler would? In other words, is the path creation process for buy/sell deals only manual \"re-entry\" of the data that will be sitting out in Contract Exchange? OR is there additional information that you need to create the path that is not sitting in Contract Exchange? This, of course, assumes that the meter has been added to the deal in Contract Exchange and the deal has bridged from SITARA to UNIFY. It seems to us that this should be possible and valuable, but please give us your input! Thanks, Carrie",

But you ,dahling, are the centerpiece here because Mother and Daddy like you best. So here are my preliminary thoughts for an Irving Houston off-Broadway play. Naturally this is based on an Ada & Mike premise. (1) This old suitcase (Daddy packed the Louis Vuitton without wheels a WEEK early but Mother wouldn't let him close it and then it wouldn't close) (2) Lovely Linda (you remember Linda, don't you?) (3) Hi Debba, Hi Sara (what's the story, morning glory, etc. and of course this is the information hot-line and Mother's source of e-mail) I'm sure I'll have many more brilliant ideas over the weekend but I wanted you to be the first to share these ideas with me.

Prior to the meeting, I wanted to share some background on how this came about and why it maybe relevant to your area of responsibility. During 2000, the International PR team wanted to develop abetter appreciation as to what corporate cultures, operating structures, strategies, tactics and tools were being used to keep pace with the ever-widening and more strategic role communication is being asked to play. As such, several companies got together and asked Laird & Associates ( who has previously completed studies for Enron) to conduct research on the following companies, i.e. BP Amoco, General Electric, Johnson and Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., McDonalds, Nestle, Nokia Corp., and Royal Dutch Shell Group. The presentation will be made by the President of Laird and Associates and you will receive the most important elements of the voluminous analysis and findings they extracted from on-site visits. For your reference, I will forward the final report to your attention. The presentation will take place at the Enron in 47C1.

         "\"CHANGE\" Meeting Levering our IT/e-commerce infrastructure",
         "I would love to hear your thoughts on this. Based on my involvement with Bridgeline, I am very comfortable in this discussion. The costs of the services is probably the weakest area as we do not have numbers yet on the costs we have been capturing in the E-work orders for Bridgeline. However, I do feel we will have very accurate numbers to provide in the future. Give meany other direction or thoughts you have. ---------------------- Forwarded by Brenda F Herod/HOU/ECT on 03/17/2000 09:28 AM --------------------------- Enron Technology From: Tommy J Yanowski 03/15/2000 12:57 PM To: Beth Perlman, Sally Beck, Brent A Price/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brenda Herod cc: Peggy McCurley Subject: \"CHANGE\" Meeting Levering our IT/e-commerce infrastructure Please read the meeting notice below. Janet Dietrich's assistant setup this meeting at my request. We want to present to the originators what IT Services are being provided to Bridgeline, discuss the value this can bring to ENA and talk about other potential deals in the works. The thought is to spur additional value creation for Enron by offering services to our customers. This would impact not only IT but Commercial Operations as well. Having them understand what value the two groups can bring to the table and how important it is for our groups to be in on the front end of these deals is important so that these potential deals are negotiated & structured correctly. Please plan on attending if your schedules permit. - Tommy Peggy: Please make sure this gets on Philippe's schedule. ---------------------- Forwarded by Tommy J Yanowski/HOU/ECT on 03/15/2000 12:44 PM --------------------------- Enron North America Corp.

These tests will involve a 14-day shut-in of Clay Basin for reservoir gas inventory verification followed immediately by a 2-day field deliverability test. During the 14-day shut-in, Clay Basin customers will not be able to utilize their storage service. However, in order to facilitate the 2-day deliverability test, an Operational Flow Order (OFO) will be issued and storage capacity holders will be required to take a pro-rata share of their withdrawal capacity from a total volume of 300,000 dth in a 32-hour period. Questar will work with storage customers to facilitate transportation of their gas supply during this time period. Questar is interested in finding ways to minimize the impact of this testing on its shippers. Please contact your Questar marketing repesentative to discuss the testing process.",

The spots highlight Enron as a leader in innovation, energy and technology; Enron's involvement in the Houston community; and our corporate environment. I have included the schedule for the next two weeks (see below). Our level of sponsorship also includes two weeks of radio promotion on KTRH and three insertions in the Houston Business Journal. Copies of the special will also be distributed to local schools. I would like to encourage each of you to tune in and watch the special on the 13th or 20th.

         "\"Alan Greenspan's outfit is troubled by a research report dated Oct. 18",
         "To all G7 clients, We are pleased to see that SOMEONE is reading our survey...hope you are too. Best regards, Jane Hartley CEO G7 Group, Inc. CONSUMERS TOO AFRAID TO SPEND By JOHN CRUDELE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ November 13, 2001 -- CONSUMERS are talking tough and optimistic, but acting weak and glum. That's the big problem in the American economy right now. And things like yesterday's plane crash - whether caused by terrorism or not - are likely to aggravate that situation. The dual personality being exhibited by Americans is bothering the Federal Reserve, whose interest-rate cuts won't be nearly as effective if consumers are too scared to borrow money. I spoke with a source of mine who is familiar with the Fed's thinking and he tells me that monetary authorities are concerned, as well as perplexed, by consumers' unwillingness to part with a dollar even as they are feigning confidence. In particular, Alan Greenspan's outfit is troubled by a research report dated Oct. 18 that was conducted by an independent Washington outfit called G7 Group. The group had the Princeton Survey Research Associates interview 1,045 adults between Oct. 8 and 10. This poll was given tome by someone close to the Fed. The survey found that post-Sept. 11, Americans were putting on a good front. For instance, 66 percent of the people polled said that now is a \"good time\" to purchase a car ora house, but 63 percent said they \"did not feel like\" making a major purchase. Only 41 percent of the respondents felt like shopping for clothes and 75 percent felt comfortable buying only necessities like groceries. Consumer confidence has been dropping since before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But the current level of confidence could be greatly overstated because it measures what people are saying and not what they are doing. And the Princeton Survey shows that consumers are talking a good game but buckling when it comes to taking an economic turn at the plate. Not surprisingly, job security is the chief concern, although Americans refuse to admit it. Even though the U.S. lost 415,000 jobs last month and our unemployment rate jumped sharply to 5.4 percent, more than 70 percent of those surveyed said they felt the same or more optimistic than they did a few months ago. The Fed cut interest rates for the tenth time last week. Another rate cutis expected in December. The Fed made an even bolder move two weeks ago when it announced that it was going to stop selling 30-year government bonds. The result was that interest rates on long bonds came down sharply, putting them more in proportion with recent rate reductions. As I've said in previous columns, the long bond has been a nuisance for the Central Bank because it hasn't declined as much as expected. This has caused things like mortgage rates to remain higher than they could have been. The G7/Princeton survey explains to the Fed why its interest rate strategy hasn't been working. But it doesn't necessarily explain why - as the surveyors concluded - \"the Sept. 11 attacks opened a chasm between what Americans are thinking rationally about the economy and what Americans are feeling as they now confront economic decisions.\" What will yesterday's incident do to confidence? That's anyone's guess. But unless the government quickly explains what happened to the public - and that's unlikely in a crash investigation like this - then Americans are likely to keep up their tough facade while being weak in the knees. Over the last decade America's mood has depended a lot on how Wall Street was feeling. The stock market dipped sharply right after yesterday's plane crash, but snapped back. The Federal Reserve figures, I'm told, that if interest rates stay down and the stock market remains stable, then Americans will eventually regain their confidence. Let's hope so. But if you are investing in a stock market that is this overpriced, you should understand that the risks are great. And they are getting greater. -John Crudele, NY Post, November 13,2001",

As such, several companies got together and asked Laird & Associates ( who has previously completed studies for Enron) to conduct research on the following companies, i.e. BP Amoco, General Electric, Johnson and Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., McDonalds, Nestle, Nokia Corp., and Royal Dutch Shell Group. The presentation will be made by the President of Laird and Associates and you will receive the most important elements of the voluminous analysis and findings they extracted from on-site visits. For your reference, I will forward the final report to your attention. The presentation will take place at the Enron in 47C1. Please feel free to invite any others you feel might benefit from this material. Thank you in advance for anticipated cooperation. Do not hesitate to call, if you have any questions.",

         "RE: NOTICE TO CLAY BASIN CAPACITY HOLDERS Questar Pipeline Company (Questar) is planning to perform Clay Basin inventory verification and deliverability tests beginning April 2, 2002. These tests will involve a 14-day shut-in of Clay Basin for reservoir gas inventory verification followed immediately by a 2-day field deliverability test. During the 14-day shut-in, Clay Basin customers will not be able to utilize their storage service. However, in order to facilitate the 2-day deliverability test, an Operational Flow Order (OFO) will be issued and storage capacity holders will be required to take a pro-rata share of their withdrawal capacity from a total volume of 300,000 dth in a 32-hour period. Questar will work with storage customers to facilitate transportation of their gas supply during this time period. Questar is interested in finding ways to minimize the impact of this testing on its shippers. Please contact your Questar marketing repesentative to discuss the testing process.",
